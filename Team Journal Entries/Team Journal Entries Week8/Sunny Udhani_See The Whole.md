### XP Core Value - See the whole

####  The xp value "see the whole" allowed me to focus on project as a whole rather than just focussing on a assigned sprint task.

* In this week, as a part of the See the whole value I pushed for a consensus on how the levels fit in the game.
	We discussed various probable arrangements for completing level, restarting a level and finishing a game as whole.
* After successful implementation of 4 design patterns, we are planning to integrate a game level implementation of two players playing concurrently.
* As a part of whole project objectives I enforced regular task board and sprint task sheet updates.
