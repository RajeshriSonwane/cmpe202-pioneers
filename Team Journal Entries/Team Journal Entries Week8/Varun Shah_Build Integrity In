XP Core Value - Build Integrity In

*The xp value "Build Integrity In" allowed me to verify that the source code successfully builds at the end of the day. 
At the end of each day I made sure that after all the content pushed on git, source code compiled and ran successfully. 
In case of any kind of error, communicated to respective person responsible for that commit and resolved the issue.

*Team made sure to free code from any kind of defect. In traditional approach, development team developes the code and QA team tests it 
and provides feedback on which development team works again. In this project, each member took full responsibilty of developing and testing 
assigned task thoroughly and only then committed it on github.
