### XP Core Value - Eliminate Waste

* Basic idea behind eliminating waste is to eliminate anything and everything that does not add value from the perspective of customer.

* Type of wastes involved can be described using acronym TIM WOOD or WORMPIT or DOWNTIME - Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Non utilized talent, Defects, Extra-Processing

* Eliminating waste in Lean overall leads to better lead time, more flexibility, increased throughput.

Activities related to Project this week :

* We have tried to eliminate extra processing through developing same game without design pattern, that lead us to understand how things work and what things should we need to do the same with design pattern and eliminate the rest.

* We are working in such a way that dependency of a component don't lead to waiting scenario for other team members. For example, we designed sprites first then used them in canvas and then used canvases to design level of game, thus we don't need to be dependent on each other by developing similar components concurrently that don't have dependency on each other.
