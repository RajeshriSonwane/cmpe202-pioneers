## XP Value: Simplicity

### Team Member: Rutvik Pensionwar

* Concentrate on the main functionality first, and then move on enhancements. This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. Our main focus was to complete two levels of game and implement as many design patterns as we can. As of now, we were able to implement some of them successfully. The list includes Factory, State, Observer and Composite.

* Take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We take care that every implementation take place in parts. These developments are tested right away. Failures if any are taken care of at that point of time. For instance, we implemented design patterns one by one, so that it doesn’t affect other execution

* We will create something we are proud of and maintain it for long term. We as a team would develop an application (platform/arcade game development) which would represent a prototype of ‘simple’ implementation. Our implementation of design patterns would make the overall game easier to understand and maintain (in case our code is reviewed by anyone in future). If the game is planned for enhancement, our effective implementation of design patterns would make communication between designers more efficient.
