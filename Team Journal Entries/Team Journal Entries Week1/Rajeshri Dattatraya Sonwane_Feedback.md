### XP Core Value - Feedback

Feedback is one of the important XP core values, which is related to other core values - simplicity and communication. The continuous feedback will make the system stronger and more dependable.
Feedback can come from different sources â€“ Feedback from the System/Program, Feedback from the Customer/User, and Feedback from the team.
* I will take feedback of the tasks of  performed by the team members no less than twice seven days with a goal to ensure that the project work is consistently going ahead according to the estimation of planning.
* On the off chance that any of the team member reports any sort of issues in his/her work to me, I will ask for all the team members for a group meeting to talk about how the issue can be immediately resolved.
* All the team members will monitor every one of the issues that we are facing during the project work and they will give feedback to me so I can ensure that if any of the team members may confront a similar issue later on, it can be quickly resolved using the past experiences.

This week, we took the feedback from other team members as well as from the seniors, regarding innovative project ideas, which design patterns and gaming framework to be used, pros and cons of using different gaming engines.
