### XP Core Value - Communication

I will be focusing on the “Communication” XP Core value and will make sure that it is followed during the entire project.
Proper communication among team members is essential for the success of the project. Teams that communicates periodically, provides efficient results in project. Communication helps team members to put their point across effectively without involving unnecessary trouble of explaining themselves later. Communication helps every member to convey effectively what they want from other members or what message they want to deliver.
Throughout the project we will be undertaking following responsibilities for proper communication:

* Whole project will be divided into small modules (backlogs) and everyone will be assigned tasks for respective sprint. 
* Weekly stand up will be kept so everyone can track each other’s progress and everyone can be on the one page. If there is any dependency on other person/module or any backlogs/hurdles that can be sorted through the meeting. 
* Communication in the weekly meetings will be documented in minute of meeting document. 
* Every person may not be available for discussion all the times and that can result in delay. So, we have created out group ‘CMPE 202 Pioneers’ on ‘SLACK’ to communicate with team members. 

This week, we discussed about innovative ideas for the game application and also discussed about various game engines to develop the game application.
