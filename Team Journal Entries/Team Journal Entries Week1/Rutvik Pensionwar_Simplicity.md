### XP Core Value - Simplicity

* Simplicity is one of the core values of XP which emphasizes upon keeping everything simple. This subjective quality focuses upon building what is essential today, and not predicting tomorrow’s needs. It means to take small, simple steps towards the goal and mitigating issues on the fly.
* Introducing an advanced technology can simplify one application and may complicate another. Several other factors influence the project roadmap. It’s my responsibility that none of the technical and operational challenges affect our project status. I would always take care that a functionality is added before it’s scheduled.
* In our first team meeting, we have discussed multiple game engines and have prioritized on the most efficient platform. As a result, we have decided to develop a user-friendly application using simple methods and implementations. Together we will judge our code subjectively using TUBE (Testable, Understandable, Browser, Understandable) qualities.
