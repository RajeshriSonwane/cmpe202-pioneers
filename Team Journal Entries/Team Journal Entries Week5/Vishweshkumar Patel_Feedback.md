### XP Core Value - Communication

* In order to achieve high quality, namely to achieve what the customer needs, very short feedback loops are used to show the development to the customer continuously.

* Thus,having continuous feedback - an incorrect development can be stopped in initial stage and better understanding of customer requirements can be achieved.

* Feedback does not only come from the customer, but also from the team members and test cases.

Activities related to Project this week :
