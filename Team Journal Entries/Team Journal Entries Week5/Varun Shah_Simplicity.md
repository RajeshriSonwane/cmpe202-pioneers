### XP Core Value - Simplicity

* Through Team meeting, everyone shared their views on how to satisfy project requirements to simplify future efforts.

* Simplicity is required to continuous progress and hazard-less integration of code.

* In order to simplify the project progress and decide how to work further, Team reports status of project.

Activities related to Project this week :

* Started the week with Scrum standup meeting, where each team member shared the progress and hurdles they are facing in any aspect of their assigned tasks and the new tasks each one taking further.
* Communicated ground rules to be followed starting Week5 where we are supposed to follow agile sprints, like daily standup timings, task creation and estimation, etc.
* Team faced certain issues due to imperfect task distribution which team collectively resolved quickly towards the end of the sprint(week).
