### XP Core Value - Courage

* Courage is needed to communicate and accept feedback. Every team member participated in sharing ideas and feedback without any fear and everyone's view was taken into account respectfully.
* Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with refactoring their code when necessary. 
* We reviewed the existing code and modified it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. We threw code away that is obsolete while developing a game, no matter how much effort was used to create that source code. 
* We worked hard when we stuck on a complex problem.
