## Respect

* Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Everyone was assigned tasks for Scrum - Week 5 and everybody undertook the jobs effectively.

* Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Initial development (designing level 1 & 2) together with canvas/atlas/architecture was efficiently completed by team members. All of us maintained respective working directories on GitHub for practice and contribituted to project by sharing their sample game.

* We know that every managing authority respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work. Just like that, every team member knew what part of development they are responsible for and are trying to implement it way ahead of schedule.
