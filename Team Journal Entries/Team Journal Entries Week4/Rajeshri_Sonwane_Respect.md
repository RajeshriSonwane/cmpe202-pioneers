## Respect

* This week, we had our weekly meeting to decide how to approach designing and development of the game. We took opinion of each team member on different activities finalized.

* We started developing our game world in phaser editor that would basically contain all the sprites and atlas involved in the game. We focussed on developing the flow of the game. So, decided different important components to be used within game.  We divided work among team members equally. Members were allowed to pick up tasks that interested them. We made sure each of the members contributed to the discussion and none of team member felt neglected or disrespected in any way.

* Next week we plan to move ahead in the developing important use cases and will work towards dividing the gameplay into different modules and work towards their completion.
