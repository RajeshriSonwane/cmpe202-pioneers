## Feedback

* Analyzed and resolved issues seriously by delivering working software (sample game). Each team was assigned a task to develop sprites and atlas components.

* Build a sample world (atlas) using all components developed by the team. We listened to everybody's opinions and integrated all components together and made changes when needed.

* We discussed some aspects of the project development and adapt our process to it, not the other way around. Everybody is genuine and open to offer/take feedback and respect it.
