### XP Core Value - Feedback

* In the last week, every member took responsibility of researching on game framework. From the feedback it seemed that, in order to understand the features everyone should develop small game app on the game engine respectively
* We decided to meet Tuesday again after each of us implement small game on their respective game engine, and later in meeting we will decide which game engine to opt for.
* I have taken feedback about the game ideas and with the decision on game engine on Tuesday, we will also finalize our game idea.
