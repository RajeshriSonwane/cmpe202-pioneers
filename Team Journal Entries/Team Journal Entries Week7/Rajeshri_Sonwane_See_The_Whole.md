## XP Core Value - See the whole

The xp value "see the whole" focussed me to look at the whole picture of how the game would look like.
* In the last week, we developed the basic level 1 and level 2design of the game.
* I took care that whatever process that is followed, everyone knows about the project as a whole.
* We also started to explore design patterns so that we can implement it in the project.
* We designed different screens to present as different levels to the players.
* Along with the development, we have also kept out scrum burndown chart updated.
* Also we regularly keep on meeting to discuss and solve design and implementation problems.
* I made sure that every team members know the whole flow of the project and can work accordingly.
