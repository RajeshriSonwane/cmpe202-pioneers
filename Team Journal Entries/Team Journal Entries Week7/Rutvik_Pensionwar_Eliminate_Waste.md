## XP Value : Eliminate Waste

### Team Member: Rutvik Pensionwar

* There are 7 particular types of wastes in manufacturing viz. overproduction, unnecessary transportation, inventory, motion, defects, over-processing, and waiting. 

* These values can be explained in a language more relevant to software development; unnecessary code and functionality, starting more that can be completed, delay in software development process, unclear or constantly changing requirements, bureaucracy, slow or ineffective communication, partially done work, defects and quality issues, and finally task switching.

* Activities related to project this week:

1.  Lot of resources were shared from day 1 that were assumed to be used for game development. These includes sprites and atlas designs according to game theme. Upon successful development of level 1 and level 2, all those irrelevant sprites and atlases were removed from our shared source folder.

2. Some of the functionalities that were implemented in week 1 but are no longer required due to design pattern constraints were eliminated.

3. We as a team took care that there's no delay in functionality implementation, thus eliminating 'delay' as a hindrance factor.
