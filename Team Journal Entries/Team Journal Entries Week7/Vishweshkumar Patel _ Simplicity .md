### XP Core Value - Simplicity

* Simplicity prefers simple designs, favouring todays requirements and not to think ahead in future. But it also suggest to be ready to adopt changes in future.  

* "Do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW) , "Keep It Simple, Stupid!â€™" (KISS) , "You Aint Gona Need It" (YAGNI), all principals lead to simplicity.

* Simplicity is driven by communication, in the sense that the more you communicate regarding requirements of project, the more you understand what features are needed, how to design them as simple as possible.
