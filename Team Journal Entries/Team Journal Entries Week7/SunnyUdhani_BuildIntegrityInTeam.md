### XP Core Value - Build 'Integrity' in Team

* “Integrity” is defined as “free from flaw, defect, and decay”. We have already targetted many ways to build integrity into our project:

### Free from 'flaw'
* We avoid flaws in our game development by aligning the progress with the final deliverable.
* Every change made in working directory is reviewed by the team before adding the change to source.

### Free from 'defect'
* TDD approach decreases the amount of time to progress from introduction of defect to actually fix it.
* Team notes down all test cases possible before actually implementing the functionality by having a quick consensus.

### Free from 'decay'
* Point one highlights the practice of prioritizing hign values items over others, which eventually decreases the amount of decay introduced into the game.
* We, as a team, monitor that every update to the game takes care of the end result. We also admire continuous integration to minimize decay in our game by notifying everyone about the flaw as soon as they are inroduced.


#### So, this week we had consensus for every change, update or add in the source in order to build integrity.
