### XP Core Value - Courage

XP teams are expected to have courage to commnicate and accept feedback. Courage cumulates various situations like:
1. Tell truth about the progress and estimates
We have researced upon multiple game enignes by developing a sample game on respective platforms. Everybody came up with the pros and cons of the game engines they have developed. The team exhibited courage by conveying genuine feedback about their platform and accepted others opinions on the issue.

2. Don't fear anything because no one ever works alone
We call ourselves a "team" and thus act accordingly. No matter which work engine we finalize, we will work together even if a member amongst us lack experience in that field/technology/language.

3. Showcase courage while adapting to changes whenever they happen
There exits a remote possibility in change of plan in terms of game engine, genre or idea, in the future. If such situation persists, we will embrace that change, create an updated roadmap, and act accordingly. We won't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.
