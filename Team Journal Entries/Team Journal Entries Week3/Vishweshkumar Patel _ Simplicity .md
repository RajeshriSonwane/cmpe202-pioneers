### XP Core Value - Simplicity

* Simplicity prefers simple designs, favouring todays requirements and not to think ahead in future. But it also suggest to be ready to adopt changes in future.  

* "Do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW) , "Keep It Simple, Stupid!â€™" (KISS) , "You Aint Gona Need It" (YAGNI), all principals lead to simplicity.

* Simplicity is driven by communication, in the sense that the more you communicate regarding requirements of project, the more you understand what features are needed, how to design them as simple as possible.

Activities related to Project this week :

* The main focus of this project is on software engineering methodologies and how teams are implementing them. Thus we have decided to design game in Javascript game engine Phaser, as implementing some design patterns in Javascript will be more straightforward.
