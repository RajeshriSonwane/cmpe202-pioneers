### XP Core Value – Communication

* We organized a meeting of all team members on Tuesday and Thursday for 2 hr. All team members collaborated with each other to talk about their perspectives and thoughts. Our main objective this week was to pick up a game topic and a gaming platform from our shortlisted topics.
* On Tuesday, we finalized a game topic from our shortlisted topics. We took utmost care that each team member got an opportunity to put forward his thoughts before the team. We evaluated work done by other team members and gave our thoughts and perspectives on it.
* On Thursday, we discussed pros and cons of all those platforms (Greenfoot, Phaser, Construct2 and Unity). We have finalized "Phaser" as our game development platform.
* After deciding game’s topic, we all started working on design patterns. All team members effectively interacted with each other via SLACK after meeting.
