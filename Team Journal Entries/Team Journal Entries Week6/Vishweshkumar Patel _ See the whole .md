### Lean Core Value - See the whole

* Software systems are not simply the sum of their parts, but also the product of their interactions.

* The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its development and the more parts are developed by different teams, 
  the greater the importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components.

* During a longer period of development, a stronger subcontractor network is far more beneficial than short-term profit optimizing, which does not enable win-win relationships.

Activities related to Project this week :
