### Lean Core Value - Eliminate waste

* Whichever features or functionalities or process steps that neither adds value nor used in project, should be considered waste and eliminated from the system/product/process.

* Lean recognizes 7 types of waste. Which team will make sure to eliminate in further development.

 1. Partially done work
 2. Extra features
 3. Relearning
 4. Hand-offs
 5. Delays
 6. Task Switching
 7. Defects

Activities related to Project this week :
