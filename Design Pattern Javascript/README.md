## Command

* The command pattern is a behavioural design pattern in which an object is used to represent and encapsulate all the information needed to call a method at the later time

* This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters



## Composite

* Allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of all objects uniformly.

* They allow you to represent part-whole hierarchies

* Components can be further divided into smaller components

* You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole object individually



## Proxy

* Provide a class which will limit access to another class

* You may do this for security reasons, because an Object is intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location.
