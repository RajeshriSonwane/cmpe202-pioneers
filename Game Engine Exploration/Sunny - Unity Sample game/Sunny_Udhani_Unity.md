## Game Engine: Unity

###Introduction

*   Unity3D is a “game development ecosystem” (s. http://unity3d.com/unity/), it includes
    an environment for the development of interactive 2D and 3D content including a
    rendering and physics engine, a scripting interface to program interactive content, a
    content exporter for many platforms (desktop, web, mobile) and a growing knowledge
    sharing community. 
*    Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices. 
    First announced only for OS X, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 27 platforms 
    
### IDE

*   Unity provides a feature-rich ide for game development, fairly complex and documentation support for the features.
*   Alongwith Unity's own IDE for game objects, it uses Visual Studio for scripting in C# or Javascript which is also feature-rich for development.

### Features of Engine

*   Inbuilt support for different physics activities and game objects for faster development and also support for game objects provided by community of users.
*   IDE shows compile time errors on the fly which helps in faster development.
*   Support for copying repeating objects.
*   2D and 3D game development.
*   Integration with documentation.

### Deployment

*   In-built game playing engine for testing games while developing.

### Cons
*   Navigates to Visual Studio for scripting.
*   Very extensive.
