## GREENFOOT

* It is an integrated development environment for teaching and learning object oriented programming. It is very specialized environment where kids can program and build games and simulations (graphical interactive applications). It helps build animations quickly and easily.

* Greenfoot uses Java. There are classes (scenarios) defined in the environment. The playground where all the objects are placed is called the world. All objects are assigned specific methods in order to perform activities.

* A typical greenfoot application looks like the one below where Flag, Lander and Explosion are the classes. We can call the constructor to add an object to world and run respective act method to run the program. The run button below executes the act method in loops, which enables the program to function continuously.
