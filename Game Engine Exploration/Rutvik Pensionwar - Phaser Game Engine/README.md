## Phaser Editor Overview

* Phaser editor is a relatively new editor that was build on the top of Eclipse to make the job easy for developers by including crucial features such as code completion and build-in HTTP server. When you first load the editor you will be greeted with a very familiar layout sticking to the tradional eclipse layout, however you can change that by simply dragging the windows around. 

* There are many templates (with description) for your use. You can play around various features of the editor and create something or select from hundreds of examples that are listed in an example section. Phaser editor comes with phaser chains meaning if you want to check out to do something, you don't have to lead the editor to do so. You can see your project listed in the project explorer. The most important of your folders is the 'Web Content'. The folder will hold everything; your code, graphics and map data. In the assets folder, there will be adjacent files where you can load and preview your assets. 

* Phaser consists of its own "level designer" using canvas files where you can literally drag sprites around and position them. There's no more hard coding or using complex third-party map editors. With phaser editor, you can just drag and drop objects and have them be a part of the scene in seconds. Audio sprite is just another feature. We can use texture atlas editor to develop texture atlases. 

* The phaser editor uses the local web server to run the program, meaning you don't have to bother with other external programs that take very long to set up.
