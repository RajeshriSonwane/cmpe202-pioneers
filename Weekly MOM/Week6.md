## Discussions

### Tasks completed till date
On our last meeting (Week 5), every team member was assigned few tasks. All of us were commited to the deadline and have finished respective tasks efficiently.
1. Designed Level 1 of the game
2. Updated spritesheet to include player and enemy movements
3. Player movements/postures include walk, jump, attack and die
4. Enemies moving to and fro on a horizontal axis
4. Introduced new sprites in order to improve animation of the game

### Tasks we are working on right now
1. Design Level 2 of the game
2. Collect the coins and increase the score counter likewise
3. Handle the player-enemy collision and end the game
4. Directing player to level 2 upon successful completion of level 1

### Problems we are facing
1. As of now, we are facing issues while embedding design patterns using JavaScript.
2. As the Scene1.js (javascript file of canvas) is automatically generated from Scene1.canvas by the tool itself, it makes the design pattern implementation a bit difficult.  

### Exercise for next week
1. We are discussing upon implementing additional design patterns from next week.
2. Every team member is responsible to embed atleast one design pattern in to the game.
3. We will start designing our UML Class Diagram highlighting the team's design pattern.
