## Discussions:

1. As every member of the team was asked to explore a game engine, we discussed pros and cons of all those platforms (Greenfoot, Phaser, Construct2 and Unity). We have finalized "Phaser" as our game development platform.

2. As far as game genre is concerned, the team considered various categories like Action, Adventure, RPGs, FPS and Mind Games. We have come up with a Platform game   where a player can:

   - walk through world (flow - left to right)
   - collect points/coins along the way to destination
   - avoid obsacles by jumping over it
   - avoid/kill enemies coming towards

3. Every member of the team is assigned two design patterns each. In the next meeting, every member will explain how they can collaborate respective design patterns into development.
