### Tasks completed till date

Since last week, the team was working on Level 2 of the game. Moreover, some of the tasks like collecting coins, incrementing the score counter, handling the player-enemy collision were carried out parallely. The tasks were allocated individually. As stated earlier, all of us being commited to the deadlines, each of the team members completed these activites efficiently.

### Tasks we are working on this week

1. Working on implementation of Factory, State, Observer, Strategy and Composite design pattern in the game (at least one per team member)
2. Directing the player to level 2 upon successful completion of level 1 (a level is completed once the player grabs every pumpkin and reaches the flag post)
3. Implement a feature of player being able to shoot fire bullets
4. Kill the enemies upon collision with fire bullets

### Problems we are facing

1. Researching a way to implement composite design pattern as our game is made of many small components
2. Problem while identifying objects representing various strategies and context objects whose behavior varies as per its strategy object
3. Implementing one-to-many relationship between objects such that dependent objects are notified once parent is modified

### Exercise for next week

1. We are planning to include additional design patterns to improve game development process
2. Try to complete activity and sequence diagrams respectively.
3. Start working on UI Wireframes and User Case specifications.
